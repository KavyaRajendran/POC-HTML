                <b>Korea</b> is a region in East Asia consisting of the Korean Peninsula, Jeju Island, and several minor islands
                near the peninsula. Korea has been divided since 1948 between two distinct sovereign states, North Korea
                and South Korea. Korea is bordered by Russia to the northeast, China to the northwest, and neighbours Japan
                to the east via the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan (East Sea).

                Heo Hwang-ok is a legendary queen mentioned in Samguk Yusa, a 13th-century Korean chronicle. According to Samguk Yusa she
                became the wife of King Suro of Geumgwan Gaya at the age of 16, after having arrived by boat from a distant
                kingdom, making her the first queen of Geumgwan Gaya. According to some Korean historians there are more
                than six million present day Koreans, of which the majority are from Gimhae Kim clan with surnames Heo and
                이 (Lee/Yi) that trace their lineage to the legendary queen. Her

                    Webtoons (Hangul: 웹툰) are a type of digital comic that originated in South Korea. While webtoons were mostly unknown outside
                    of the country during their inception, there has been a surge in popularity internationally thanks in
                    great part to most manhwa being read on smartphones. As digital manhwa have emerged as a popular medium,
                    print publication of manhwa in South Korea has decreased. The amount of material published in webtoon
                    form has now reached an equal amount as that published offline.

                    <h4>
                        <u>Origins and history</u>
                    </h4>
                    <p> The Korean web portal Daum created a webtoon service known as Daum Webtoon in 2003 and was later followed
                        by Naver with the launch of Naver Webtoon in 2004. These services regularly release webtoons that
                        are available for free. According to David Welsh of Bloomberg, comics account for a quarter of all
                        book sales in South Korea, while more than 3 million Korean users paid to access online manhwa and
                        10 million users read free webtoons. As of July 2014, Naver had published 520 webtoons while Daum
                        had published 434. Since the early 2010s, services such as TappyToon and Spottoon have begun to officially
                        translate webtoons into English while some Korean publishers like Lezhin and Toomics have begun to
                        self translate their works.[ Examples of popular webtoons that have been translated into English
                        are Lookism, Untouchable, Yumi's Cells, Tales of the Unusual, The God of High School, Noblesse, and
                        Tower of God. In recent years, these webtoons have been gaining popularity in Western markets, rivalling
                        Japanese manga.[ In the past, it was divided into two ratings: All (webtoon suitable for all ages)
                        and 18 (No one under 18 is allowed to read this webtoon). From May 2019, the webtoon rating system
                        was implemented. It is said that 10 platforms including Naver and Daum will participate. The ratings
                        are expected to be △ All △ 12 years or older △ 15 years or older △ 19 years old (18 years old) or
                        older

                        <img src="content/images/330px-Webtoon_Zeroth_generation.png " alt="Generation zero Webtoon">
                        <br> Earliest webtoons were scanned original comics uploaded onto the Internet, usually formatted on
                        a one-page layout.
                    </p>
                    <h4>First generation </h4>
                    <p>
                        With the development of technology, authors were able to utilise flash animation effects.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Second generation </h4>

                        <br> Enhanced preloading enabled later authors to adopt a vertical layout with scrolling. In contrast
                        to comics with a dense panel composition, scrolling brings new panels into view. This makes webtoons
                        suitable for gradual and continuous representation, allowing webtoon reading to become more fluid.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Third generation </h4>
                    <p>With the advent of the smartphone and tablet, webtoons have also migrated to new platforms such as apps.
                        There was also introduced sounds to imply further expressions and tones, as well as interactive motions
                        to create excitement and bring attention to certain objects for the viewers.

                    <p>In mainland China and Taiwan, webtoons along with web manhua have seen an increase in production and
                        popularity since they are rarely published and just like in South Korea, have resulted in a resurgence
                        and interest in the manhua industry as more content is consumed digitally. Almost all of the big
                        webtoon portals in China are offered by the big internet companies in the country while in Taiwan
                        the bigger webtoon publishers outside of the country like Comico, Toomics, and Line Webtoon are more
                        popular since their services are available there.
